\section{Position of the problem}

To simulate the inelastic wall, we say that if $x(t+1) = -1.2$ then we calculate $v(t+1)$ with $v(t)$ set to zero. This way, the negative speed is canceled and the car can move to the right with positive speed.\\

Intuitively, the optimal value function would reach a maximum at position $x = 0.6$. On positive positions, it would be huge for high speeds, and lower for lower speeds as it won't be enough to reach the top of the mountain. It would also be large for negative positions and speeds, as it is then gaining momentum before to climb the mountain.

\section{Approximate Value Iteration : Fitted-Q iteration} 

At each n draws of couples $(s,a)$, we learn the parameters $\alpha$ with a least-squares regression. In order to gain time, we initialize the $\alpha$ with negative values, as the value function should be negative (reward = 0 in position 0.6 and -1 elsewhere).\\
In the deterministic case ($\epsilon = 0$), with 20 features, and 5000 draws at each iteration, we get a convergence in 5 iterations, and here is what we obtain for the approximated optimal value function :

\end{figure}

If we take only 10 features, we get

\end{figure}
The general shape of $Q$ is not very different, but obviously there are not enough features, because $Q=0$ on a large part of the mesh. 
\\When increasing to 30 features, we get results very similar to what we get with 20 features.

\end{figure}
The more features we take, the more iterations are needed for $\alpha$ to converge : 15 iterations for 30 features, 4 for 10.
